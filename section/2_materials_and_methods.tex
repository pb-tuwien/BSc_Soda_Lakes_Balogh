The TEM method was originlly introduced for mining applications~\parencite{chandra2016tem} 
and was since adopted to other fields like groundwater, 
and geothermal exploration~\parencite{chandra2016tem, everett2013tem}.

\subsection{Transient Electromagnetic Method}\label{subsec:tem-method}
The transient electromagnetic (TEM) or altenatively time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) method was
proposed by \textcite{obukhov1968fields} and has been intensively developed 
in the 1980s~\parencite{christiansen2006tem}.

For the TEM method a pulse of current is transmitted through a ungrounded transmitter loop 
generating a primary magnetic field~\parencite{chandra2016tem,christiansen2006tem}.
When the current is turned off, the decay of the primary field induces 
secondary currents (eddy currents) in the ground,
which produce a secondary magnetic field~\parencite{chandra2016tem,christiansen2006tem}.
This is governed by the Maxwell equations, which state that a changing electrical field 
induces a magnetic field, and vice versa~\parencite{christiansen2006tem}.
An electromagnetic (EM) wave propagating through the subsurface, 
is attenuated by the electrical properties of the materials it encounters~\parencite{christiansen2006tem,everett2013tem}.
The strength of the secondary magnetic field depends on the conductivity of the material the EM wave propagates through 
and by measuring this field over time using a receiver loop, 
information about the subsurface can be obtained~\parencite{christiansen2006tem,chandra2016tem}.
Such a decay curve of the secondary magnetic field over time is called a ``transient'', 
with an numerically modelled example shown in \cref{fig:typical_sounding}(b).

    the signal (b), and the apparent resistivity (c).}
    \label{fig:typical_sounding}
\end{figure*}


% By analysing the decay characteristics of the secondary field, it is possible to infer the conductivity structure of the subsurface,
% because the wave propagates deeper into the subsurface, later times include information about deeper layers.
% Such a decay curve is called a transient and multiple transients are measured for each sounding to counteract the random noise in the measurement.
% An EM wave attenuates faster in conductive materials, which results in a shallower investigation depth.
% For this reason the TEM method was developed to find conductive materials like ores, clay, and water-bearing formations in resistive media.
% As the interpretation of the data is computationally intensive and requires sophisticated instruments to measure the secondary field accurately,
% this method is rather ``young'' compared to other geophysical methods like electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and magnetotellurics (MT)~\parencite{christiansen2006tem}.

% In order to get information on the subsurface resistivity, the measured signal must be converted to an apparent resistivity ($\rho_a$).
% This can be done by using the formula for late stage behaviour of the secondary field:
% \begin{equation}
%     \rho_a = \frac{1}{\pi} \left( \frac{M}{20 \cdot \frac{\partial b_z}{\partial t}} \right)^{\frac{2}{3}} \left( \frac{\mu_0}{t} \right)^{\frac{5}{3}}
%     \label{eq:apparent_resistivity}
% \end{equation}
% where $M$ is the magnetic moment, $\frac{\partial b_z}{\partial t}$ is the signal measured by the receiver coil,
% $\mu_0$ is the magnetic permeability of free space and $t$ is the time.
% The magnetic moment is the product of the number of turns, the area, and the current in the transmitter loop.
% The apparent resistivity is a measure of the resistivity of the subsurface material the EM wave has traveled through,
% but it is not the true resistivity of the material.
% For this reason inflection points can be interpreted as boundaries between different layers with different resistivities,
% and the slope of the curve shows whether the resistivity is increasing or decreasing in the new layer~\parencite{fitterman1986transient}.


% Another approach is to use the inversion of the data to create a model of the subsurface resistivity.
% This is explained in more detail in~\cref{subsubsec:data-inversion}.
% For the interpretation of TEM data -- and for the inversion in particular -- some assumptions must be made:
% EM waves only propagate vertically and the subsurface is layered.
% As most inversion algorithms are work with a 1D model, the subsurface is assumed to be homogeneous in the horizontal direction.
% Even with these limitations the TEM method is a powerful tool for the
% exploration of the subsurface and can be used in various applications~\parencite{christiansen2006tem}.

\subsection{Experimental Set up}\label{subsec:set-up}
In order to investigate the applicability of automatically determining an optimal lambda value to TEM data, 
we conducted a field survey in October of 2024 at the Martenhofer Lacke in the Nationalpark Neusiedlersee - Seewinkel. 
The Geophysics Research Unit at TU Wien kindly provided data from May 2024 for the same 
location but with a differing measuring configuration, which enables a comparison between varying setups.

Furthermore a python package was developed to read, filter, and invert the TEM data.
The visualisation of an L-curve as well as several methods of automatically finding an optimal lambda were also implemented. 

\subsubsection{Measuring Device}\label{subsubsec:device}
Both survey were conducted with the TEM-Fast 48 HPC system by Applied Electromagnetic Research (AEMR).
It is compact device allowing the use of a single-loop configuration. 
By connecting an external $12~/~24\,V$ battery a current either $1~/~4\,A$ can be put through the connected transmitter loop.
It records up to 48 logarithmically spaced time gates, which results in a time range between $4 - 16000\,\mu s$.
The specific number of time gates can be chosen through a time-key. \cref{tab:time-key} shows which time-key leads to which recording time range.
To provide an optimal signal-to-noise ratio the device automatically stacks multiple pulses~\parencite{barsukov2015shallow}.
The number of stacks are given by the formula $P_{tot} = 13 \times n_s \times n_{as}$~\parencite{aigner2021flexible}, 
where $n_s$ ($1-20$) is the chosen stacking-key and $n_{as}$ is the number of analogue stacks depending on the chosen time-key 
and can be found in \cref{tab:time-key}.
More detailed infromation on the device can be found in the manual provided on the website \url{http://www.aemr.net/tem-fast.htm}.

\subsubsection{Field Survey}\label{subsubsec:field-survey}
The field measurements were carried out at the Martenhofer Lacke in the \textit{Nationalpark Neusiedlersee - Seewinkel} (16° 51' 23.058'' N, 47° 45' 8.4348'' E),
which is located on the east side of the Neusiedler See, Austria.
Being part of the Seewinkel, which are intermittent alkaline soda waters, this water cycle of this lake is fueled by deep saline groundwater and evaporation 
leading to its high salinity and shallow water depth, which also varies throughout the year~\parencite{boros2025can}.
This location was chosen due to having sparse man-made structures in the Nationalpark, 
which reduces noise in the gathered data to a minimum~\parencite{aigner2024sensitivity}.

The first survey, consisting of 45 soundings as shown in \cref{fig:may-map} with a $12.5\times12.5\,\text{m}$ loop, was carried out on the 22nd May 2024 
and for the second survey 66 soundings, visualised in \cref{fig:oct-map} with a $6.25\times6.25\,\text{m}$ loop were measured on 8th October 2024.
For both surveys a Voltage of 24V was used and \cref{tab:sounding-parameters} shows the parameters for each sounding.
Based upon a first visual inspection of the data some soundings were marked as "anomalous" as seen in \cref{fig:may-map,fig:oct-map}.

\subsubsection{Python Package}\label{subsubsec:inversion}
In order to process the gathered data, we developed a python package mainly based on open-source python libraries.
For the inversion routine we built upon the work of \textcite{aigner2021flexible}, 
which combines the electromagnetic wave modelling capabilities of \texttt{empymod}~\parencite{Werthmüller2017}
with the inversion algorithm from \texttt{PyGIMLi}~\parencite{rucker2017pygimli}.

The capabilities of this package include the reading of TEM data, adding coordinates to each sounding, 
the filtering based upon a time intervall, and the visualisation of the raw with the filtered data.
The inversion routine requires certain starting parameters like the lambda value, a layer distribution, 
a start model, and the relative error of the measured signal.
If not specified otherwise a homogeneous model with the median apparent resistivity of the sounding is used as the starting model
and the relative error is computed based of the error output of the measuring device.
In case of particularly noisy data it is possible to set a minimum value for the relative error (noise floor).
The noise floor limits how strongly the inversion algorithm tries to fit the model to each data point to avoid fitting errors.
This inversion algorithm works with a model of the subsurface, 
where a resistivity value is assigned to a layer with a certain thickness, 
and only modifies the resistivity value of every layer while keeping the thicknesses fixed.
This makes the choice of an appropriate layer distribution (specifying the number and thicknesses of layers) vital~\parencite{Welkens2025}.

We also implemented the functionality to compute and visualise an L-Curve for a TEM sounding.
For this we run the inversion for various logarithmically spaced lambda values, 
specified by the lower bound, the upper bound, and the number of values. 
For each inversion, we compute the root-mean-square (RMS) misfit of the data with the model 
as well as the roughness of the model and use these two values as the coordinates of a point
corresponding to each inversion, which should result in an L-Curve~\parencite{cultrera2020simple, hansen1999curve}.

To find an optimal lambda value for the inversion we implemented several search algorithms, 
which all try to find the point (corresponding to a lambda value) with the highest curvature on the L-Curve~\parencite{lloyd1997use,cultrera2020simple}.
We implemented the method used by \textcite{lloyd1997use}, which fits a cubic spline function to the L-Curve and 
computes the first and second derivative of this function, which are used to compute the curvature of the function at each point.
We also implemented a similar approach, where we used the \texttt{numpy.gradient} function 
(\url{https://numpy.org/doc/1.26/reference/generated/numpy.gradient.html}) to compute the first and second derivative for the curvature.
Lastly we implemented the iterative golden section search algorithm as described by \textcite{cultrera2020simple}, 
where a lower and upper bound is defined for the lambda value and by comparing two curvatures within the interval and discarding the lower one,
this method contracts the interval towards the optimal lambda.
The advantage compared to the other two methods is that it is not bound to the predifined list of logarithmically spaced lambda values, 
which in theory allows a more precise determination of the optimal lambda.
