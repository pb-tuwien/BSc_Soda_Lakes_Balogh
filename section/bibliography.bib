  abstract = {Water-borne transient electromagnetic (TEM) soundings provide the means necessary to investigate the geometry and electrical properties of rocks and sediments below continental water bodies, such as rivers and lakes. Most water-borne TEM systems deploy separated magnetic transmitter and receiver loop antennas—typically in a central or offset configuration. These systems mostly require separated floating devices with rigid structures for both loop antennas. Here, we present a flexible single-loop TEM system, the light-weight design of which simplifies field procedures. Our system also facilitates the use of different geometries of the loop antenna permitting to adjust the depth of investigation (DOI) and the minimum sounding depth in the field. We measure the turn-off ramp with an oscilloscope and use the DOI to assess the minimum and maximum exploration depth of our single-loop TEM system, respectively. A reduction of the loop-antenna size improves early-time TEM data due to a reduced length of the turn-off ramp, whereas an increase of the loop-antenna size enhances the signal strength at late times, which allows to investigate deeper structures below the lake bed. We illustrate the capabilities of our system with a case study carried out at Lake Langau in Austria. Our results show that our system is capable of reaching a DOI of up to 50 m (with a maximum radius of the circular loop of 11.9~m), while it also resolves the water layer down to a minimum thickness of 6.8~m (when the radius is reduced to 6.2~m).},

We propose novel open-source forward modeling and inversion routines for single-loop TEM data including IP effects with the maximum phase angle model to model the frequency dependence of the complex resistivity. In a first step, we evaluate the accuracy of our forward modeling and inversion routines using numerical studies, where the actual variations of layer thicknesses and resistivities, as well as the frequency dependence of the complex resistivity is known. In a second step, we extend our investigation to field data and apply our approach to three distinct case studies in layered media: 1) a confined aquifer corresponding to conductive non-polarizable media, 2) a graphite deposit corresponding to highly conductive and polarizable anomalies in a resistive host rock and 3) an ice glacier corresponding to highly resistive polarizable media. Our DGSA results reveal that standard depth of investigation (DOI) approaches may overestimate the true sensitivity of the model obtained from the inversion. TEM data collected in conductive layered media without IP effects show reduced sensitivity above the predicted DOI. The case studies in polarizable media demonstrate that the maximum phase angle is more influential on the TEM model response than the relaxation time and dispersion coefficient. Our DGSA results for polarizable media reveal that TEM field data collected at the graphite deposit and at the ice glacier are sensitive to the geometry of the polarizable layer.},

  abstract = {Understanding processes in the Critical Zone requires reliable information about the vadose-zone aquifer, its geometry, and spatial variability. Commonly, such information is obtained from boreholes, yet large areas might render their application prohibitively expensive. Additionally, limited geological a-priori information might bias the interpretation due to lateral geological changes smaller than the borehole sampling scale. The transient electromagnetic method (TEM) has emerged in the last decades as a well-suited method to efficiently investigate the subsurface, as required for many hydrogeological applications. The interpretation of TEM measurements relies mainly on deterministic inversions, offering only a limited insight on the uncertainty of the subsurface model. Uncertainty quantification, however, is essential for integrating TEM results into hydrogeological models. Hence, we propose a combined approach using both deterministic and stochastic inversion of TEM soundings to investigate the uncertainty of shallow (\$\&lt;\$ ~\$40 \textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{m\}\$) aquifers. Current stochastic approaches for TEM data rely on Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, which have to be run from scratch for each individual sounding. Alternatively, machine learning approaches, such as Bayesian Evidential Learning (BEL), can be much faster because they do not require retraining for every new data set. Hence, we investigate, in particular, the application of a single, common prior model space instead of multiple, individual prior model spaces to directly estimate the uncertainty of multiple TEM soundings. To this end, we combine forward modelling routines with the stochastic inversion approach BEL1D and assess our approach using both field data and numerical experiments.},

Existing geophysical methods are capable of imaging this zone; however, they have limited efficiency when it comes to creating full 3D images with high resolution over dozens to hundreds of hectares. We have developed a new and highly efficient towed transient electromagnetic (tTEM) system, which is capable of imaging the subsurface up to depth of 70~m at a high resolution, horizontally and vertically. Towed by an all-terrain vehicle, the system uses a 2×4\,\,m2×4\,\,m transmitter coil and has a 𝑧z-component receiver placed at 9~m offset from the transmitter. The tTEM uses dual transmitter moment (low and high moment) measurement sequence to obtain the early and late time gates corresponding to shallow and deep information about the subsurface layers. The first bias-free gate is as early as 4\,\,μ⁢s4\,\,μ⁢s from beginning of the ramp (1.4\,\,μ⁢s1.4\,\,μ⁢s after end of ramp). Data are processed and inverted using methods directly adopted from airborne electromagnetics. The system has been successfully used in Denmark for various purposes, e.g., mapping raw materials, investigating contaminated sites, and assessing aquifer vulnerability. We have also used the tTEM system in the Central Valley of California (United States) for locating artificial recharge sites and in the Mississippi Delta region, to map complex subsurface geology in great detail for building hydrogeologic models.},

In the TEM-FAST technology, a single square or rectangular loop is used as the TR and R antennae (the so-called single-loop TEM configuration). This enables three objectives to be reached at the same time: first, time variations of the magnetic flux through the loop are measured, and the effects of subsurface irregularities in the antenna vicinity are integrated maximally; second, efficiency of the field experiment grows significantly since a second loop placement or induction receiver installation is no longer necessary; and third, the measured transient process shows a series of unique helpful peculiarities used in performing the transformations. Electric prospecting methods are usually divided into those employing either the direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). The advantage of DC methods is their high sensitivity to local geoelectric inhomogeneities, especially high-resistivity ones. Among the AC methods, the most popular ones are magnetotelluric sounding (MTS), frequency sounding (FS), and the transient electromagnetic method (TEM) and its modifications. MTS and FS methods are based on the determination of electric conductivity functions in a frequency domain. TEM methods work in the time domain, which provides a higher resolution compared to the frequency sounding methods, although the EM fields in these methods are defined by the diffusion equations.},

Their European hotspot is located in Central Europe, where LN stands as the largest threatened representative, giving it practical importance. This study aims to compare fundamental hydro-ecological variables of LN, including a habitat restoration site (LNres), with intermittent alkaline soda waters (IASW) in the adjacent subregion (Seewinkel). IASW serves as a characteristic close-to-nature reference status for natural ASW in order to restoration suggestions for LN. Variables investigated include depth, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, algae-free suspended solids, chromophoric dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll a. Significant differences were found among most variables between the three sites (Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA and Dunn's test), except for water depth, DO, conductivity, TSS-Algfree and CHL between IASW and LNres, and CDOM between LNres and LN. Principal component analyses revealed that LNres is situated between LN (semi-static) and reference IASW (astatic), supporting the hypothesis that LNres is closer to the reference IASW than the non-restored part of LN. The hydro-ecological properties of IASW and LNres are similar to the shallow shoreline of LN, suggesting that management strategies of intermittent waters can be applied to shoreline restoration of semi-static waters. This can be achieved by restoring seasonal water dynamics and groundwater function through extensive wetland rehabilitation in the above-ground and below-ground watershed recharge area of LN. Additionally, extensive vegetation control (reed) should be implemented to prevent ASW from impacting the habitat and freshwater exchange.},

These variations can be translated into lithological layers with hydrogeological characteristics, such as unconsolidated and consolidated formations, sand and clay beds, presence of fresh and saline groundwater and conductive contamination plumes etc. It can also be used to assess weathered zone thickness, map resistive bed rock and approximate the presence of conductive shallow fractured zones.

Innovative instrumentation combined with multi-dimensional modelling and interpretational insights based on experience gained through numerous case studies have proven to be a successful strategy. In the case study reported here, the combination revealed an unknown and unexpected buried valley complex. Drill hole data were in good agreement with estimates of both the bearings and depths of valleys defined by the TEM surveys. The Pulled Array Transient Electromagnetic (PATEM) system was built to provide high data density for increased lateral resolution. A High moment Transient Electromagnetic (HiTEM) system was developed for delineation of aquifers to depths up to 300 m. Because both of these systems provide high data density, data quality can be assessed as part of the interpretational strategy. When acquiring TEM measurements in areas as densely populated as the Danish countryside, precautions must be taken to minimize coupling between the TEM system and man-made conductors. Modelling the slope of the flanks of buried valleys has challenged the adequacy of the one-dimensional (1-D) assumption for inversion of TEM data. The study shows that for a valley structure in a low-resistive layer, the 1-D assumption is sufficient to track the presence of rather steep slopes. For a valley structure in a high-resistive layer, however, the insensitivity of the TEM method to resistors makes it difficult to determine a slope with a 1-D inversion, and only the overall structure is defined.},

  abstract = {The electromagnetic (EM) induction method, traditionally used for mining, groundwater, and geothermal exploration and geological mapping (Grant and West, 1965; Nabighian, 1988; 1991), is growing in popularity for near-surface geophysical applications (McNeill, 1990; Nobes, 1996; Tezkan, 1999; Pellerin, 2002; Fitterman and Labson, 2005; Everett, 2012). The controlled-source variant of the method utilizes low-frequency ( 1–100 kHz) time variations in electromagnetic fields that originate at or near the surface and diffuse into the subsurface. The ground-penetrating radar (GPR) technique is distinct from the EM induction method in the sense that the former utilizes a higher frequency range {$>$} 1 MHz for which wave propagation, rather than diffusion, is the dominant energy transport mechanism. The diffusive regime is marked by the requirement σ {$>>$} ωε where σ [S/m] is electrical conductivity, ω [rad/s] is angular frequency, and ε [F/m] is dielectric permittivity. The latter plays no physical role in the EM induction method. Instead, EM induction measurements respond almost entirely to the bulk subsurface electrical conductivity and, in particular, the spatial distribution of highly conductive zones (Everett and Meju, 2005). Instrumentation is readily available, easy to use, and reliable. Electric fields are sensed by pairs of grounded electrodes, i.e.voltmeters, while time-variations of magnetic fields are most commonly sensed using induction coils.IntroductionThe electrical conductivity structure of the subsurface, as determined from EM induction measurements, can be interpreted in the context of a wide variety of potential targets and application areas, see Table 8.1. Fundamentally, EM methods respond with good sensitivity to fluid type, clay content, and porosity.},

These groundwater problems require determination of the depth to bedrock; location of resistive, high-porosity zones associated with fresh water; determination of formation resistivity to assess water quality; and determination of lithology and geometry, respectively. The TS method is best suited for locating conductive targets, and has very good vertical resolution. Unlike other sounding techniques where the receiver-transmitter array must be expanded to sound more deeply, the depth of investigation for the TS method is a function of the length of time the transient is recorded. Present equipment limitations require that exploration targets with resistivities of 50 Ω·m or more be at least 50 m deep to determine their resistivity. The maximum depth of exploration is controlled by the geoelectrical section and background electromagnetic (EM) noise.

The electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) profiles, calibrated with lithological, physicochemical and geophysical log data, were used to demarcate the geometry of the aquifer system and characterize the extent of the interface between saline and freshwater in a coastal groundwater system, which has been subject to overexploitation for the last 35~years. In total, 12 deep high resolution ERT profile lines, covering a distance of approximately 15~km were carried out at key locations across the downgraded part of the aquifer system. The resistivity sections were calibrated using a reference dataset of 45 information wells incorporating 28 lithological logs, 31 groundwater quality samples from a variety of screen placements and five gamma ray logs. Results revealed the presence of four major resistivity zones ranging in values between 0.1 and 150~Ωm at various depths and locations. A very low resistivity zone (0.1–5~Ωm) correlated with saline water saturated layers, a medium resistivity zone (5–15~Ωm) attributed to clays and silts, and two high resistivity zones generally representing freshwater saturated sediments of coarse grain size (15–40~Ωm) or alterations of thin marl and fine sand layers (40–150 Ωm). It is demonstrated that extensive use of high resolution deep geoelectrical sections, calibrated with a large number of hydrogeological data can successfully delineate aquifer geometry dimensions, identify hydraulic boundaries and clarify ambiguous field measurements, thus allowing the development of a thorough hydrogeological conceptual model.},

  abstract = {Generally, the electrical method of geophysics is potentially valuable in typifying the subsurface conductivity and its surrounding medium. Sixteen datasets of 1-D electrical resistivity survey was integrated with 8 core samples, which were taken in the neighbourhood of eight of the sixteen VES datasets. The two sets of data were intertwined with geological and hydrogeological datasets to enhance the realization of unique results used in assessing the aquifer geo-matrix and pore water geo-resistivity in four counties in the coastal province of Akwa Ibom State, southern Nigeria. The current electrode separations of 1-D resistivity data were extended up to 300~m to ensure that the prolifically exploited water-bearing units were assessed. The VES data were manually and electronically modeled and each of them showed characteristic four geo-electric layers with KH, HK, KQ, HA and A group of curves. The core samples, which cut across the local Government Areas under survey, included sandy clay (12.5\%), fine-grained sand (50.0\%), medium-grained sand (12.5\%) and coarse sand (25.0\%). Bulk resistivities of water-bearing units and other primary geo-electrical indices were measured in all sixteen locations. However, in the eight aquifer core sample locations, water resistivities were measured in situ. The core samples were taken to the laboratory for measurements of fractional porosity and volumetric water content. The measured fractional porosity ranged from 0.189 to 0.267 with an average of 0.232, whilst volumetric water content varied from 0.23 to 0.31 with an average value of 0.268. The transmission coefficients were computed from volumetric water content and other parameters in the work. The values ranged from 0.4135 to 0.5612 with an average value of 0.4945. Fractional porosity was also modeled from field parameters and the results showed a good match with laboratory measurement as the root—mean square error was just 1.3\%. Intrinsic specific resistance and conductivity of soil aquifer matrix were found to be \$\$3.333 \textbackslash times 10\textasciicircum\{3\} \textbackslash;\textbackslash Omega \{\textbackslash text\{m\}\}\$\$and \$\$3.000 \textbackslash times 10\textasciicircum\{ - 4\} \textbackslash;\{\textbackslash text\{Sm\}\}\textasciicircum\{ - 1\}\$\$respectively. The study has provided useful information about the geo-electrical and geo-pore properties of the prolifically exploited aquifers in the study area. The aquifer parameter contour maps have been delineated and these, together with other parameter relations generated in this study could help in predicting the volumetric conductivity between pore water and the matrix texture of hydrogeological units in the study area and other areas with similar geology.},

  abstract = {The porous aquifers in the area called Challapampa are the most important groundwater reservoirs that supply drinking water to Oruro city in the highlands of Bolivia. They consist of unconsolidated fluvial–lacustrine deposits, resting on a complex sedimentary bedrock and covered by a thin surficial clay layer. The settings of these geological units and the structures governing the flow patterns have barely been investigated, despite this reservoir having been utilized during the last 50~years. This study applied transient electromagnetic (TEM) soundings and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) in the middle part of the alluvial fan of River Paria to investigate the thickness of the porous aquifer and detect the relief of the bedrock. Likewise, some results expressed as resistivity models indicate the possible existence of geological structures below the unconsolidated sediments. The average depth of investigation reached in this study is between 200 and 250~m below the surface, for both the applied methods. The geological structures inferred have similar directions as the major faults in the vicinity, from southeast to northwest, which in turn are assumed as part of fractured aquifers underlying the porous aquifers. The geo-electrical techniques were successfully tested in the study area and the resistivity models from TEM complement very well those obtained from ERT. Therefore, extended investigations using the same techniques would help to develop a more complete description of the hydrogeological settings of the aquifer system.},

Local villagers who use groundwater reported that in some places groundwater has a salty taste. In order to investigate the origin of this problem, several TEM soundings were performed in the study area, and they were complemented with ERT surveys. The results show top layers with resistivity values ranging from 30 to 200~Ωm and a bottom layer with resistivity values ranging from 1 to 20~Ωm, which might be interpreted as the main aquifer and a layer with high clay content, respectively. Between the top and bottom layer, a transition zone with saline water has been identified, with resistivity values ranging from 0.1 to 1~Ωm. The origin of this closed-basin brine might be a product of the evaporation of paleolakes during the lower Pliocene, where saline clays were deposited. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of TEM sounding for mapping very low resistivity zones such as saline water.},

The main purpose of this paper is to advocate the use of this graph in the numerical treatment of discrete ill-posed problems. The graph is characterized quantitatively, and several important relations between regularized solutions and the graph are derived. It is also demonstrated that several methods for choosing the regularization parameter are related to locating a characteristic L-shaped "corner" of the graph.},

The quality of the solution is critically dependent on the choice of λ. if A is plotted against B for all λ values then a curve with a characteristics L-shape is obtained and the solution at the corner has an optimum balance of fit and smoothness. We demonstrate the usefulness of the L-curve method in this application and show that it provides a good means of choosing λ.

  abstract = {Many tasks in applied geosciences cannot be solved by single measurements, but require the integration of geophysical, geotechnical and hydrological methods. Numerical simulation techniques are essential both for planning and interpretation, as well as for the process understanding of modern geophysical methods. These trends encourage open, simple, and modern software architectures aiming at a uniform interface for interdisciplinary and flexible modelling and inversion approaches. We present pyGIMLi (Python Library for Inversion and Modelling in Geophysics), an open-source framework that provides tools for modelling and inversion of various geophysical but also hydrological methods. The modelling component supplies discretization management and the numerical basis for finite-element and finite-volume solvers in 1D, 2D and 3D on arbitrarily structured meshes. The generalized inversion framework solves the minimization problem with a Gauss-Newton algorithm for any physical forward operator and provides opportunities for uncertainty and resolution analyses. More general requirements, such as flexible regularization strategies, time-lapse processing and different sorts of coupling individual methods are provided independently of the actual methods used. The usage of pyGIMLi is first demonstrated by solving the steady-state heat equation, followed by a demonstration of more complex capabilities for the combination of different geophysical data sets. A fully coupled hydrogeophysical inversion of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data of a simulated tracer experiment is presented that allows to directly reconstruct the underlying hydraulic conductivity distribution of the aquifer. Another example demonstrates the improvement of jointly inverting ERT and ultrasonic data with respect to saturation by a new approach that incorporates petrophysical relations in the inversion. Potential applications of the presented framework are manifold and include time-lapse, constrained, joint, and coupled inversions of various geophysical and hydrological data sets.},

Developed as a rapid alternative to ground-based, transient electromagnetic measurements, the resolution capabilities are comparable to that of a conventional 40 × 40 m2 system. Independent of the helicopter, the entire system is carried as an external sling load. In the present system, the transmitter, mounted on a lightweight wooden lattice frame, is a four-turn 12.5 x 12.5 m2 square loop, divided into segments for transmitting a low moment with one turn and a high moment with all four turns. The low moment uses about 30 A with a turn-off time of about 4 |as; the high moment draws approximately 50 A, and has a turn-off time of about 80 |J,s. The shielded, overdamped, multi-turn receiver loop is rigidly mounted on the side of the transmitter loop. This is essentially a central-loop configuration with a 1.5 m vertical offset. In vertical hover mode the SkyTEM responses were within 2\% of those from a conventional ground-based system. Instrument bias level is not a concern as high-altitude tests showed that the background noise level is higher than the instrument bias level. By inverting a sounding from a test site to a standard model and then applying the SkyTEM system parameters to compute the forward response, conventional measurements were within 5\% of SkyTEM responses for flight heights of 7.25, 10, and 20 m. Standard field operations include establishment of a repeat base station in the survey area where data are acquired approximately every 1.5 hours, when the helicopter is refuelled, to monitor system stability. Data acquired in a production survey were successful in detecting and delineating a buried-valley structure important in hydrogeophysical investigations.},

Because the self and mutual induction effects are difficult to calculate, the transient electromagnetic method (TEM) using small-fixed loops is challenging to obtain ideal induced electromotive force through numerical simulation. The existing related research lacks model tests; we have established five model tests were used to investigate the transient electromagnetic response using small-fixed loops to typical geological anomalous bodies based on the common construction accidents. Compared and analyzed the transient electromagnetic inversion results of the central loop and the small-fixed loops before and after correction. The results show that both the central loop TEM and the TEM using small-fixed loops observation data could well reflected the geological anomalous bodies. Compared with the central loop results, the corrected TEM using small-fixed loops has a more accurate response to anomalous bodies and can better delineate its spatial distribution and shape characteristics. The research results effectively guide the practical engineering application and obtain good detection results. Theory and practice show that compared with the traditional central loop transient electromagnetic detection, the TEM using small-fixed loops has higher exploration efficiency and detection accuracy of typical geological anomalous bodies.},

The bottleneck in frequency- and time-domain calculations of electromagnetic responses derived in the wavenumber-frequency domain is the transformations from the wavenumber to the space domain and from the frequency to the time domain, the so-called Hankel and Fourier transforms. Three different Hankel transform methods (quadrature, quadrature-with-extrapolation [QWE], and filters) and four different Fourier transform methods (fast Fourier transform [FFT], FFTLog, QWE, and filters) are included in empymod, which allows us to compare these different methods in terms of speed and precision. The best transform in terms of speed and precision depends on the modeled frequencies. Published digital filters for the Hankel transform are very fast and precise for frequencies in the range of controlled-source electromagnetic data, but they fail in the frequency range of ground-penetrating radar. Conventional quadrature, on the other hand, is in comparison very slow but can model any frequency.

  abstract = {The traditional large-loop transient electromagnetic method (TEM) is strongly affected by the large terrain undulations and limited working space in mountainous areas. A multi-turn small-loop TEM is thus more convenient and flexible in these environments because of the small size of the working loop. However, notable mutual inductance occurs between the transmitting and receiving loops in the multi-turn small-loop configuration, which leads to low inversion resistivity values and an inaccurate time–depth conversion, which therefore results in inconsistencies between the inversion result and actual situation. In this paper, a method based on joint geophysical prospecting is used to constrain the multi-turn small-loop TEM data processing procedure and overcome the shortcomings of this configuration. A karst detection experiment was conducted in Zhijin County, Guizhou Province, China. Borehole data with intuitive and accurate strata information were used to determine the depth coefficient and adjust the karst burial depth. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), which could provide more accurate resistivity values than TEM when it has sufficient geological information to constrain the inversion process, was thus used to reduce the TEM errors and obtain a more accurate time–depth conversion and resistivity. A three-dimensional model of the karst channel was established according to the corrected resistivity and burial depth parameters, and the model reliability was verified by a separate borehole.},
