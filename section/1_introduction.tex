Introduction including:
Objective: Create a model of the subsurface resistivity at Martenhofer Lacke using the transient electromagnetic method.

Hypothesis: An optimal lambda can be found for the TEM data gathered at Martenhofer Lacke by using the L-Curve method.

Research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How suitable is the transient electromagnetic method for the investigation of the resistivity of the subsurface at the Martenhofer Lacke?
    \item Which configuration of the TEM method is most suitable for the investigation of the Martenhofer Lacke?
    \item Is the L-curve method suitable for the determination of the optimal lambda for the TEM data?
    \item Which conditions are necessary for the L-curve method to be applicable to the TEM data?
\end{itemize}
